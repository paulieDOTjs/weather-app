A simple weather app. Users can put in a city of their choosing and the app will generate the current conditions, temperature, humidity wind speed and UV index, as well as a background that fits that current condition. The app will then generate the weather over the next 5 days displaying the date, conditions, temperature, humidity, and changing the background to an image that fits. The app saves past searches in local data and has clickable links on the right hand side to search for those cities again. The app will always open back up with the most recent search.
